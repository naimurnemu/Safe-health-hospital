          As you can see, the Best Hospitals have much more in common than
          objective results and hard metrics. They put the patient first in
          everything they do, approach care with compassion and understanding,
          are committed to rigors required for excellence, foster a culture of
          innovation, and rely on Spok for communication when seconds count.
